## Game Features
this game is based on minecraft as it features different enemy mobs like zombies,
skeletons and endermen. There is also a blaze boss that spawns when the player kills 
all mobs. Since it's an infinite game and the spawn rate increases over time, it gets
more and more difficult to get to the boss fight. But the more enemies the player kills,
the better his weapon becomes: starting from a wooden sword to a diamond one.
The player can not only loose hp displayed in an hp bar,
but also gain some by collecting hearts moving down the map.

About the mobs:
Enderman: can teleport, his last known position is getting indicated, does melee damage.
Skeleton: fires projectiles towards the player, projectile dies when exiting the gameboard,
does not do melee damage.
Zombie: runs around randomly, does melee damage.

About the sound:
The background music is unique for the game, it was composed in collaboration with a friend of mine.
All the collision sound effects, the boss spawn- and player death sound effect are
entirely "inspired" from minecraft.

Please don't judge my code too much, it is quite late and those 100 magic number issues were juicy...
